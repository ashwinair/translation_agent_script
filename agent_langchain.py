    2. Analyze the meaning of the translated value '{original}' in {language}.
    3. Identify synonyms or rephrasings of the English value that preserve its meaning, then adapt them into {language}.
    4. Select the option that fits within {max_length} characters without losing the original intent.
    5. the return translation only be in {language} not in english or any other language.
